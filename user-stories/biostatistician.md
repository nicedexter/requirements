# Efficient Data Access and Analysis Environment

**As** Benjamin Nguyen, Biostatistician,  
**I want to** have a clear view of all CHUV datasets, understand how to access and analyze them, and set up a dev environment that supports scripting in R/Python,  
**So that** I can efficiently perform statistical analysis and ensure traceability of datasets and environments while sharing results with stakeholders.

## Success Criteria
- Clear overview of available datasets
- Functional development environment for R/Python
- Ability to run overnight analyses
- Traceable environment setup and dataset usage
