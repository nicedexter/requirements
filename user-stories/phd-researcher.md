# Analyze Heavy iEEG Data for Brain-Heart Research

**As** Florian Perrin, PhD student at CHUV,  
**I want to** store, transform and analyse heavy iEEG data recorded in epilepsy patients,  
**So that** I can study brain-heart interaction across vigilance states (wakefulness and sleep). More precisely to use heartbeat evoked potential to study the network underlying the autonomic control of the cardiac function.

## Success Criteria
- Successful storage and management of large datasets (20-60GB)
- Ability to access data remotely
- Stable environment for running heavy analyses
- Efficient pipeline for electrode localization
