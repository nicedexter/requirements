# Standardize Seizure Detection Algorithm Evaluation

**As** Jonathan Dan, a Postdoctoral Researcher in the Embedded Systems Laboratory at EPFL,  
**I want to** design and provide a standardized and well-documented framework for evaluating EEG-based seizure detection algorithms  
**So that** I can share it with the machine learning community and enable to compare algorithm performances in a reliable and reproducible way, ultimately contributing valuable findings to the epilepsy research community.

## Success Criteria
- Framework is publicly accessible
- Includes standardized validation methods
- Supports multiple data formats
- Enables algorithm comparison
- Maintains privacy of sensitive data
