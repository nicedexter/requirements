# Research Data Governance Management

**As** Carmen Ruiz, Data Protection Officer,  
**I want to** have a clear overview of all ongoing research projects, the data being used, and who has access to it,  
**So that** I can ensure the hospital complies with data protection regulations and minimize the risk of non-compliance.

## Success Criteria
- Complete visibility of ongoing research projects
- Clear tracking of data access and usage
- Automated compliance monitoring
- Efficient communication with research teams
