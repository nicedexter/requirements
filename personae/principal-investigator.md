# Persona: Dr. Marie Fischer

| Age | 49  |
| --- | --- |
| Occupation | Chief Resident and Clinical Researcher |
| Specialization | Neuro-oncology |
| Experience | 24 years in academia and clinical research |
| Location | CHUV, Switzerland |
| Analytics Proficiency | Low coding skills, basic statistical software, imagery software |
| CHORUS Role | Workspace Owner |

## Goals

- Study the overall survival (OS) of patients with brain tumors undergoing radiotherapy or pharmacological treatment.
- Collaborate with a professor of AI at the nearby technical school (EPFL).
- Develop a machine learning (ML) algorithm that accurately predicts OS for each patient, aiding clinical decision-making.

## Frustrations

- Difficulty in accessing data and required tools to perform data analysis (protocol, ethics approval, data sources, contacts).
- Ethics, regulatory and technical limitations for sharing data among institutions (data privacy and security).
- Challenges in integrating clinical data with AI methodologies effectively (data quality and completeness, harmonization, anonymization, interoperability, resource constraints).

## User Story: Launch and manage a research project on CHORUS

As Dr. Marie Fischer, Chief Resident and Clinical Researcher in the Department of Oncology, **I want to** study the overall survival (OS) of patients with brain tumors who undergo radiotherapy or pharmacological treatment, **so that I can** develop a new machine learning (ML) algorithm with my colleague AI professor at EPFL to predict OS more accurately for each patient.

## Scenario

| Homepage Overview | Marie navigates to the CHORUS website where she is presented with a clear and concise overview of CHORUS, including its purpose, features, and ongoing projects. |
| --- | --- |
| Homepage Access | She signs in to access her home dashboard for general information and her personal workspace for experimenting with data and analytical tools. |
| Project Lifecycle | Marie can access an overview of the project lifecycle describing the different steps, tasks and contacts relevant to her project giving her a clear view on how to best proceed. |
| Support and Documentation | She accesses comprehensive documentation, including research guidelines and best practices, data usage guidelines, tutorials, and contact information for support. |
| Dataset Exploration | Marie browses and searches through the available datasets, using filters based on inclusion criteria to determine whether she can use available data for her project. |
| Dataset Overview | She views detailed information about each dataset, including metadata, methodology, and associated publications. |
| Dataset Access | Marie requests access to specific datasets in a standardized format for further analysis. She is notified when she is granted access. |
| Data de-identification | She requests support for data de-identification to be able to share data with her external colleague. |
| Project Workspace | She requests creating a project workspace and is notified once it is active. She defines project members and their access rights (for internal and external collaborators). |
| Research/Analytics | Marie wonâ€™t be performing analysis. She has defined the scientific goals together with her colleague, AI professor (described in protocol). Three project members will perform data analysis accordingly. They will use Python with libraries xxx, 3D Slicer and FreeSurfer going through the App Store. |
| Results and publications | Marie can view and discuss the results within the project workspace. She can export graphics and tables to include in her presentations, reports and publications. |
| Collaborative Opportunities | The platform provides information on collaborative projects, and Marie can find opportunities to connect with other researchers working on related topics. |
| Feedback and Contribution | Marie provides feedback on the platform and contributes her own datasets and findings to enhance the resource for the scientific community. |
