## Goals

- Have a clear view of all available CHUV datasets, including understanding how to access data and what variables mean, to start analysis smoothly.
- Have a fully functional **development environment** for **R/Python scripting**, with the ability to **run programs overnight**. Ensure **traceability** of the **environment setup** and the **datasets used** for each analysis to maintain transparency and reproducibility.
- Be able to share results with stakeholders and get help quickly from resources like Stack Overflow/ChatGPT whenever encountering issues.

## Frustrations

- Not able to quickly locate and access datasets hampers her ability to begin her analyses efficiently.
- Navigating the hospital's data access protocols can be time-consuming, causing unnecessary delays in her work.
- Limited computational resources can lead to bottlenecks, preventing her from running large-scale analyses or overnight jobs.

## User Story: Managing Data Governance in the Hospital

As Benjamin Nguyen, Biostatistician, **I want to** have a clear view of all CHUV datasets, understand how to access and analyze them, and set up a dev environment that supports scripting in R/Python, **so that I** can efficiently perform statistical analysis and ensure traceability of datasets and environments while sharing results with stakeholders.
