## Goals

- Oversee that all ongoing research projects within the hospital strictly adhere to national and international data protection regulations (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.).
- Gain visibility into what research projects are ongoing, where the data is being used, and ensure the correct permissions and protocols are in place.

## Frustrations

- No system in place to track ongoing research projects, making it difficult to understand where data is stored and who has access to it.
- Difficulty in ensuring that all projects adhere to regulations due to fragmented data and project management.
- inability to identify data flows across the hospital hinders collaboration and compliance monitoring.
- Manual efforts are required to get updates from different teams about data governance for various projects.
