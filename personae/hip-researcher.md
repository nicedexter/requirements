## User Story: Launch and manage a research project on CHORUS

As Florian Perrin PhD student at CHUV, **I want to** store, transform and analyse heavy iEEG data recorded in epilepsy patients, **so that I can** study brain-heart interaction across vigilance states (wakefulness and sleep). More precisely to use heartbeat evoked potential to study the network underlying the autonomic control of the cardiac function.

## Goals

- Define and apply the best possible pipeline/workflow to reconstruct electrode localization and obtain the precise coordinates of every plot.
- Centralize and easily access my data
- Have flexibility to test different analysis approaches and applications

## Frustrations

- Recording for 1 night can go up to 20 GB, with analysis up to 60 GB, on my computer I have only 300 GB so it is complex to manage data management and analysis
- Not able to access my data from anywhere
- My computer often crashes and I have to restart my computer and the analysis, loosing a lot of time
- Certain software take long time to launch on my personal computer

## Requirements

| Data | Big storage |
| --- | --- |
|     | Ensure that data are safe and will not disappear |
|     | Donâ€™t need to keep my computer on for analysis to run |
|     | Access my data and analysis from anywhere |
|     | Have enough resources to run heavy analysis |
|     | Organize my data by (sub-)project |
|     | Other project members should have access to data and analysis |
|     |     |

## Scenario

Notification system for analysis that finished

Danshboard with details on running apps (how long running, how long workbench open, ressources used for analysis)

Roadmap with project steps

Search bar where I can ask which apps I can use for a specific type of data

Export graphs, results, harmonize way to export among apps

Easy BIDS conversion with clear explanations/tutorials
